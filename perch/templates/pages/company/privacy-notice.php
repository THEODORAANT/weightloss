              </b>

              <p>
                How do we collect your personal data?
              </p>
              <p>From the first moment you interact with GetWeightLoss, we are collecting your personal data. Sometimes you voluntarily provide us with personal data, sometimes personal data about you is collected automatically, and sometimes we collect it from third parties, including our Partner Prescribers. How we collect your personal data will usually depend upon our relationship with you (and we have provided some examples below).
              </p>
              <b>
                <p>What personal data do we collect? </p>
              </b>
              <p>Why do we collect your personal data? </p>
              <p>Data protection law requires that we only use your personal data for purposes that we tell you about and where we have a legal basis to do so. Here are the purposes and legal bases for which we process the personal data talked about above:</p>
              <p>

              <p>1. To provide the Services to you:
                To offer and provide you with our Services (as defined in our Terms & Conditions), including our weight management-related services; to register you with a GetWeightLoss account; to connect you to Partner Prescribers, Partner Contributors & Associate Practitioners; to run our online health community and provide you with advice and content.
                ‍
                Legal basis for this data usage: Contract (where an inability to use such data will mean we may not be able to provide the Services), Consent (for use, and sharing, of your health data in connection with the Services provision)
              </p>
              <p>2. To fulfill your orders:

We use internal tools and third party software, and retrieve information we or service providers hold about you, for the purpose of sending automated responses.
                Legal basis for this data usage: Contract, Legitimate interests (to administer our business)
              </p>
              <p>4. To send you marketing that you have asked us to or we think you will like: 
                To send you marketing or promotional information; to send you reminders about services or products that you have expressed an interest in. Where you have consented, we may also use your health data to send you marketing information that is tailored to you or we think could be of interest to you.
                Legal basis for this data usage: Consent, Explicit Consent (to send marketing communications to potential customers or customers where processing of health data is involved)
              </p>
              <p>5. Seeing adverts for GetWeightLoss online:
                We use online advertising to keep you aware of what we are offering and to help you see and find our products and services. How we use your personal data to do this is further described in the ‘Online Advertising’ section below.
                Legal basis for this data usage: Explicit Consent (where processing of health data is involved)
              </p>
              <p>6. To improve GetWeightLoss:
                To improve GetWeightLoss or any of GetWeightLoss's brand group companies’ products and services, including analytics, research and development or to otherwise manage our business, and including our website. 
                Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interests (to improve our business); Consent
              </p>
              <p>7. To enable us to comply with the law:

                Legal basis for this data usage: Legal obligation
              </p>

                Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interests (enforcing or protecting our legal rights)
                More information on what this means;
                Contract: Processing your personal data is necessary for a contract you have with us, or because we have asked you to take specific steps before entering into that contract. For example, we need to process your personal data (contact details, billing information) in order to provide you with any products that you have purchased.
                Consent: We ask for your consent to process your personal data in certain circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>We provide further details on this below.
                Provision of healthcare or treatment: Processing your health data is necessary for the provision of health treatment being processed by or under the responsibility of a health professional, which includes pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. We rely on this legal basis where we process your health information where you use our online pharmacy services and purchase from us prescription-only medicine.
              </p>
              <p>Legitimate interests: Processing your data is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests. Our legitimate interests are listed above.
              </p>
              <p>Legal obligations: Processing your data is necessary for us to carry out our obligations under applicable law. For example, to carry out identity checks to comply with anti-fraud rules in the UK when you make a purchase from us.
              </p>
              <p>Consent / Explicit Consent</p>
              <p>We obtain your consent in order to collect and share (including with Partner Prescribers) any of your health data provided as part of the online questionnaire. You provide this consent when you start the questionnaire and provide us with answers to the questions. However, it is important that you understand that when you purchase any medications from our pharmacy, we rely on the different legal basis of ‘provision of healthcare’, as described above, in order to fulfil that prescription.
              </p>
              <p>We also seek your consent to use your personal data to personalise any marketing that we may send you in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Where processing of health data is involved in any marketing or advertising activities, we obtain your explicit consent.
              </p>
              <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You may withdraw your consent by contacting our Privacy Team (see ‘Contact Us’ below).
              </p>
              <p>
                Direct marketing</p>
              <p>Under UK data protection legislation, we usually need your consent to send you any direct electronic marketing messages (e.g. by text, email etc.).
              </p>
              <p>We may also send you marketing messages which are relevant to you based on your health data, but only where you have explicitly consented to your health data being used in this way.
              </p>
              <p>You can opt out of receiving some or all marketing messages at any time if you do not wish to receive these from us. You can do so by following the unsubscribe link included in the marketing message or by contacting our Privacy Team (see ‘Contact Us’ below).
              </p>
              <p>Online advertising</p>
              <p>You may see GetWeightLoss banners and ads when you are on other websites and apps, such as social media. We manage this through a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and use a range of advertising technologies.
              </p>
              <p>We use tools of social media platforms to advertise our products and services (e.g. Facebook Custom Audience). We use these tools to match information that we hold with personal data in their database to create custom audiences and tailor advertising to your interests on the internet, including social media, as permitted by applicable law. Some of this is done through ‘re-targeting’, which displays advertisements relevant to GetWeightLoss products and services you have previously viewed on our website. For example, we may provide email addresses that we obtained from you (e.g. when providing this to us as part of the questionnaire) to a social media platform, which are then usually hashed (encrypted) and matched against their own data, for them to present sponsored posts in your feed. We do this to offer tailored advertisements that may be of interest to you if you have shown an interest in our products.
              </p>

              <p>If you opt-out of receiving all marketing messages from us then we will not share your personal data for these purposes.
              </p>
              <p>We also use cookies to create more relevant marketing for you and to present relevant content to you on third party websites. This is based on your cookie consent when you visit the GetWeightLoss website (if you have given this to us). See our Cookie Notice for further details.
              </p>
              <p>Who do we share your data with?</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is necessary for us to share your personal data with third parties. Your personal data is shared only when we consider it to be necessary and according to the safeguards, and for the purposes, detailed in this privacy notice. We will never disclose your health data unless we have a lawful basis to do so.
              <ul class="notice_explain">
                <li>Partner Prescribers<p>We need to share your personal data with the Partner Prescribers so they can carry out consultations with you. This includes the sharing of your health data as part of the online health questionnaire where you have consented.

                </li>
                <li>Your GP<p>Where you have provided consent for us to do so and/or in accordance with legal and regulatory obligations & standards, we share your personal data with your GP for the purposes of providing them with information about your medicine subscription.

                </li>
                <li>Third party service providers<p>We share your personal data with various third-parties that we rely upon to perform a variety of services on our behalf and to help grow and improve the GetWeightLoss business, such as IT service providers (including cloud IT service providers), payment system operators (such as Shopify or Stripe), delivery and fulfilment providers (in order to deliver your subscription), third parties who carry out identity checks on our behalf, our professional advisors (such as lawyers) and any other organisations that provide us with technical and support services.

                </li>
                <li> Third party providers<p>We may share your personal data with third party providers that we partner with to provide d tailored advertising services to us.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Regulators or other authorities<p>We will share your personal data where we are legally required to do so or where we think this is required and we are permitted to do so, for example to respond to a request for cooperation from a relevant authority.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Other third parties to protect us<p>We may share your personal data as required in order to help prevent fraud or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any of our group companies.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Other parties as part of a corporate transaction<p>If it is proposed that we are to merge with or be acquired by another business in the future, we may share your personal information with potential purchasers, where this is necessary, or the new owners of the business or company.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Overseas transfers of personal data<p>From time to time, we may transfer your personal data to parties outside of the UK, e.g. to our group companies or Partner companies.

                </li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Where we do so, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal data as in the UK. We do this by sending your data to countries that the UK has deemed to provide essentially equivalent protection or by entering into UK approved standard contractual clauses (including the European Union standard contractual clauses alongside the UK addendum) with the relevant party.
              </p>
              <p>How do we protect your personal data?</p>
              <p>We care about protecting your personal data. That's why we take steps to make sure that we have in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal data from being damaged, changed, lost, used in the wrong way, or accessed by people who do not have permission.
              </p>
              <p>In particular, we maintain appropriate physical, organisational and technical measures so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, or modification of personal data. This includes access controls, encryption, security audits of our systems and protection of data integrity.
              </p>
              <p>Where we use third party service providers to help provide the Services, we have contracts in place with those third-party service providers which require them to implement security measures to protect the data they hold and have in place appropriate security measures.
              </p>
              <p>However, please remember that you provide personal data at your own risk: unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure.
              </p>
              <p>How long do we keep your personal data?</p>
              <p>We will retain your personal data for so long as we have a valid purpose, and for so long as required to comply with applicable law, establish legal defences and resolve disputes. When determining this retention period we take into account any record retention requirements under law and any limitation periods relevant to legal action.

              <p>You can exercise your rights by sending us an email at privacy@getweightloss.co.uk
              </p>

              <p>You have the right to be ‘forgotten’ by us: You can do this by asking us to erase any personal data we hold about you in certain circumstances, including if it is no longer necessary for us to hold that personal data.
