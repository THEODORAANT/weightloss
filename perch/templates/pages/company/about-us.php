                  <p>
As a nation the U.K. is getting bigger with more of us tipping the scales into obesity. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="clinically_text_content">
                  <p>
Obesity in the UK is driven by a complex interplay of environmental, behavioural, and socioeconomic factors. A major contributor is the widespread availability and aggressive marketing of high-calorie, ultra-processed foods. In 2024, food companies increased advertising spend by £420 million ahead of new regulations, leading to a surge in sales of unhealthy snacks. Additionally, a study found that 60% of takeaway meals exceed the recommended 600-calorie limit for a single meal, with some containing over 3,000 calories.
                  </p>
                </div>
        <p>Physical inactivity also plays a significant role. Many individuals have sedentary jobs and rely on cars for transportation, leading to reduced daily physical activity. This imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure contributes to weight gain.
         <p>   Socioeconomic factors exacerbate the issue. Unhealthy food options are often more accessible and affordable, particularly in deprived areas, making it challenging for residents to maintain a healthy diet.</p>
           <p> While genetics can influence susceptibility to obesity, the rapid rise in obesity rates is largely attributed to these environmental and lifestyle factors. Addressing obesity in the UK requires comprehensive strategies that promote healthier food environments, encourage physical activity, and consider the socioeconomic barriers individuals face.</p>
          <p>  What we are trying to do is put you on the path, where success in weight loss through the support of weight loss injections also rebalances your view of food, encourages lifestyle changes through movement and exercise whilst helping you establish better nutritional choices. The posts we make will promote changes in these areas giving you the tools to better understand your weight and aid you in longer term weight loss.
