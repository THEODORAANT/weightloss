                  <b><p>5. Our Contract With You</p></b>
 <p>5.1 Brief Overview of the Services. 
 We, with the assistance of registered pharmacists and thorough medical consultations via our online questionnaires completed by you will endevour to provide you with the best product for your needs. Through your completed questionnaire we are able to determine if you are suitable for the treatment you desire. It is at the discretion of our prescribers to accept or decline an order based on their medical assessment of your completed questionnaire. If it is determined by the prescriber that you are eligible for treatment, a confirmation notification will be sent informing you about the progress of your order. The pharmacy team will thereafter dispense and deliver the medicines directly to you
 </p>
<p> 5.2 Completion of questionnaire. 

 Once you have been successfully registered with Get Weight Loss in terms of clause 4 above, you will be requested to complete a health-related questionnaire for the purposes of ordering the medicine category you wish to obtain. Please note that the information and advice provided by Get Weight Loss when you use the Service is based on the information you supply to us. It is your responsibility to ensure this information is correct and complete, and you accept that failure to do so (whether intentionally or not) will affect the information and advice we give to you and the medicines we supply to you and, as such, may have consequences for which we are not responsible
 </p>
 <p>5.3 Order Number. 

 We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.
 </p>
 <p>5.4 Payment. 

 On submitting your questionnaire and order for your desired medicine or medicine category, you will be required to make payment for your order, as directed.
 </p>
 <p>5.5 Assessment by prescribers and prescription of medicine. 

 Upon receipt of your completed questionnaire and payment, our prescribers aim to respond within 24 hours on weekdays, and 48 hours on weekends. Please note that these timelines are only a guideline and, although we will endeavour to meet these timelines, we cannot guarantee such timelines. Our prescribers can only make a decision as to whether it is in the best interests of the patient to receive a medicine when he/she has all relevant information. On occasion, this may require the prescriber to ask you for additional information further to the information that was provided in response to an online questionnaire. If it is determined by our prescriber that it is not clinically appropriate to prescribe the requested medicine or category of medicine, a refund will be issued to you within seven working days and a notification will be sent out to you, through our patient portal, informing you of the reason why the treatment was declined.
 </p>
 <p>5.6 Concluding a binding contract. 

 When we receive your completed questionnaire, payment and order for the Services, we will confirm that we have received your order by sending a confirmation email to the contact email address that you supplied. Your order is an offer to purchase the Services and will not be binding on us until we prescribe your medicine. Professional codes of conduct and legal restrictions may limit the number and frequency of any item we are permitted to supply to you and, as such, we have no obligation to supply quantities exceeding the relevant permitted maximum and will charge only for those we do supply. We reserve the right to reject any order. Futhermore, should we be unable to identify you through the submission of your identification document and video, we have the right to cancel your order.
 </p>
 <p>5.7 NO RIGHT TO CANCEL THE ORDER/AGREEMENT. Please note that when you take up a service that involves the prescribing of medicines (such as the Services), this will require us to perform an assessment of your clinical suitability for the medicines before the medicines can be prescribed or otherwise approved for supply – in other words, the supply of the Services (including the prescriber's assessment of your questionnaire and prescription of medicines) is personalised to you. You agree to us commencing this service and an assessment of your clinical suitability for medicines when you place the order and, as such, you will have no legal right to cancel your order under applicable consumer protection legislation, including to the extent applicable, The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013. Under certain limited circumstances, we may, using our sole discretion and considering the circumstances, consider a cancellation request from you if we receive such request prior to us confirming your order via e-mail.
 </p>
 <p>5.8 Delivery. 

 We may charge you for the delivery service and may increase or decrease the prices we charge for this from time to time. For general delivery terms, see clause 6 below.
 </p>
 <p>5.9 Non-availability/substitutes.

 </p>

Please contact us should you intend to return any unwanted medicines.
 </p>
 <p>5.11 Follow-up.

 </p>
 <p>5.12.5 you will accept the prescriber's decision if he/she determines that it is not in your best interests to receive the requested medicine or medicine category without the benefit of a face to face consultation;
 </p>
 <p>5.12.6 for certain matters including our weight loss service , it is mandatory that we notify your GP of your treatment with us. However, we will always offer to notify your GP of any medicines that we have prescribed, but if you decline to take up our offer to contact your GP, it is your responsibility to notify your GP. If you decide not to notify your GP, it is important that you keep a record of any medicines that we have prescribed. However, please note that in an emergency situation, we may need to contact a healthcare professional, social services or the emergency services without your consent, even where you have declined any of our offers to contact your GP; It is not possible to complete a weight loss consultation without consenting to us notifying your GP and this action is mandatory to be eligible for the service. Consent cannot be withdrawn retrospectively after we have approved your treatment.

                  <b><p>6. Delivery of the Dispensed Medicine</p></b>
                  <p>6.1 We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If our supply of the dispensed medicine is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event.
 </p>
 <p>6.2 If you are not at home when the dispensed medicine is delivered. If no one is available at your address to take delivery and the dispensed medicine cannot be posted through your letterbox, we, through the relevant third party service provider, will leave your package in a safe place or with a neighbour if suitable. If this is not possible they will leave you a note informing you of how to rearrange delivery or collect the dispensed medicine from a local depot.
 </p>
  <p>6.3 If you do not re-arrange delivery. If, after a failed delivery to you, you do not re-arrange delivery or collect the item(s) from a delivery depot, we may charge you for any storage costs and any further delivery costs; we may end the contract and clause 7.2 may apply.

You should check the contents of each delivery promptly upon receipt.

In the event of any damage to the medication, you must send a picture that visibly shows any damage to the medication within 24 hours of delivery to our patient care team. In some instances, packages may be disfigured in transit due to the size and content of the box. In this case, the contents inside should be checked in the first instance as the medication may be fine to use. Our packaging is temperature controlled and designed to keep the medication safe. We would advise putting the package in the fridge immediately and contacting our team if you are unsure and require further information. Any issues with failed or missing deliveries should be communicated to us within 24 hours of the scheduled delivery date.
 </p>
 <p>6.7 While we undertake to use reasonable endeavours to have the medicine delivered to you within the delivery date selected, time is not of the essence, and we shall not be in breach of the terms or have any liability whatsoever to you for failing to make the medicine available on the agreed delivery date.
 </p>
 <p>6.8 You, or your nominated representative, are responsible for taking receipt of your medicines. Any signature or acceptance of the delivery by you or your nominated representative will be confirmation of the receipt of your order, and our obligations in relation to that delivery will be fulfilled.

                  <p>8.1 Where to find the price for the Services. The price of the Services (which includes VAT) will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the price of the Services advised to you is correct. However, please see clause 8.3 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the Services you order.
                    </p>
                   <p>8.2 We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT. If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the Services, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the Services in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.

                   <p>8.3 What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Services (and medicines) we provide may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the Services' correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the Services' correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order.
